# Research-Notes
My notes on the research papers I read as well as a practice repository of papers researched for Allure of Academia.

Inspired by [Daniel Takeshi's Paper Note's](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes) and a wild thought.

**Note:** the year is my timeline ( the year I read the paper ) and not when the paper was published.
